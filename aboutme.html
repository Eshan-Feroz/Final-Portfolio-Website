I go to Tillicum Middle School and I live in Bellevue, Washington in the United States. Some of my hobbies are to do card tricks, cubing, biking, playing badminton, and reading during my freetime. 
            I am a student in WhiteHat junior, and I  have created many games like pong, trex game, angry birds game, and I have even designed a game by myself called Crossy Road using javascript and some html! It has been a great experience so far in WhiteHat Junior!
            Some of the languages I speak at home with my family are English and Malayalam. In school, I am learning French, and I am almost completed with the whole course.
            Since I was little, my favorite thing to play with are legos, and things you can build. I like Legos the most because there are a variety of sets and buildings to create!
